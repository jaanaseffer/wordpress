== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I embed the booking calendar on a page or post? =

By using the 'Add Calendar' button above the editor, the Gutenberg module, or a widget.

= Will this booking system work for me? =

We're pretty sure about that! We made this plugin as 'flexible' as possible. The booking plugin works with bookings on a per day basis (no time slots). So if you rent something out on a daily basis, then the WP Booking System is a good choice.
